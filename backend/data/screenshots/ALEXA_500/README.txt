Method
------
All screenshots were taken manually between April 11 and April 13, 2021 using
the hardware and software listed above. Before taking each screenshot, all
visible popups (e.g., accept all cookies) were closed and the website
language and location was set to English and United States (if possible),
respectively. The IP address of the computer used to access the websites was
located in Finland. The screenshots (1280 x 800 pixels, PNG format, 24-bit
per pixel) include only the top part of a website's landing page. Nine out of
500 URLs did not return a response, and thus no screenshot is available.
